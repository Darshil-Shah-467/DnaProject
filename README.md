## Compression and Security for DNA Data Storage
The application demonstrates the implementation of a technique 
for efficient compression of input DNA string and its subsequent 
retrieval by the state-of-the-art algorithm like LZ77 and some 
modifications specific for DNA strings as inputs. The project also uses 
cryptographic technique to ensure the security of the files worked upon 
by the system. 

## Technology Stack
The application is built using Java Springboot for the backend services 
and Java Swing for building GUI. The group prefered to generate an executable 
file over a web application so as to prioritize running the application locally, without the need 
of the internet and also for long-term sustainance of the application. 

For cryptographic operations, the project uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specification. 

## Demo

The demonstration of usage of the application is shown in the video below.
